# liri-node-app

The problem this liri-app is trying to solve is trying to ease your ability to look for specific songs, movies and concerts.
This "liri" node app will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

This app contains files that include .env, .gitignore, liri.js, package-lock.json, package.json, and a random text file. 
These text files pare through all the information that node will be using to pull up the information you're looking for from these apis. 

The .env file contains our API KEYS that all of our packages/js are pulling from. 

For this app you will enter in npm install...then

"node liri.js with the following ..

concert-this

spotify-this-song

movie-this

do-what-it-says

then an a movie title, song, or band name in relation to the command.

Information should show up that includes information about your input.
